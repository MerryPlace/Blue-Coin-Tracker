    <string name="coin_title_nb_01">Under the falls</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_nb_01">Look underwater to the left of where the water fall lands. Follow the trail of gold coins to find a blue coin at the end. There is a bubba swimming around down here who should be avoided.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        You may want to avoid collecting all the gold coins on the swim down as you may need them for air on the swim back up. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_nb_02">Two coins float just above the water. This one is to the left as you start. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Both coins are much easier to get once the water has been cleaned up starting &lt;b>episode 5&lt;/b>, until then use the boat to reach them.&lt;br>
        In &lt;b>episode 1&lt;/b> the boat is right next to the first coin instead of at the boathouse where it normally is. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_nb_03">Two coins float just above the water. For this one, go to the left end of the cliff where it bows out in a semicircle. Then go straight out to sea from there to see the coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Both coins are much easier to get once the water has been cleaned up starting &lt;b>episode 5&lt;/b>, until then use the boat to reach them. &lt;br>

    <string name="coin_title_nb_04">Upper right cubbyhole</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_nb_04">Go up the right cliff face and when you reach the second to last ledge, the one where the second pulley drops you off, check on the right for some narrow ledges sticking out of the cliff face.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        &lt;i>Hover&lt;/i> to the first one, then &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to the one on its right, where there may be a springboard. Use the springboard to get the ledge above, the do a series of back-flip and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> combinations to reach a ledge with a rocket nozzle crate. Back-flip and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to the cubbyhole above to find a coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        In &lt;b>episodes 5 and 7&lt;/b>  the springboard is missing but it\'s still possible, though more difficult, to reach the ledges above it. Instead of stopping at the next to last ledge on the route to the top of the waterfall, go up another ledge, then do a triple jump right and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i>.&lt;br>&lt;br>

        Visible in all episodes except 3, but not reachable in &lt;b>episode 5, 7 or 8&lt;/b> because the rocket nozzle isn\'t there.</string>

        Go right and drop down to a ledge with a puddle of water, hop left from there and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to a hole under the diving board, then collect the coin there. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        In &lt;b>episode 6&lt;/b> there is a turbo nozzle crate here as well, but in other episodes there is a block of ice with a 1-up inside. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_nb_07">From the hole under the diving board, drop and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to another hole directly below. There is a vertical passage hidden behind a wall above this, though there are some windows to mark its position. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Do a series of wall jumps to get to the top and collect the coin that\'s visible through the windows. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        See the coin "Lower pulley crevice" for an alternate and perhaps easier route. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_nb_08">Get to the top of the purple shell tower. This is easiest to do in &lt;b>episode 6&lt;/b> since there are wires you can use to get from tower to tower.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        When you get to the shell entrance do a back-flip to the top. In earlier episodes you can use the rocket to this spot. From the shell, look straight toward the cliff face and notice a cubbyhole.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Rocket or &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> toward it to either land inside or grab the ledge, then pick up the coin. For an alternative strategy, see the "Tricky ruins cubbyhole" coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>

        It\'s much easier to do this in &lt;b>episode 8&lt;/b>  because the columns have gold coins as well and you can refresh your air. Also the gold coins surrounding the blue coins make it easier to spot the location from a distance. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        In &lt;b>episode 8&lt;/b>  there are two additional columns with gold coins only, so keep looking until you\'ve found all six coin columns. Some of the coin columns go almost up to the ceiling so don\'t let yourself sink far when you\'re searching. &lt;br>&lt;br>
