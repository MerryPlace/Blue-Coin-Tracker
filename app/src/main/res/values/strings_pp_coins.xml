    <string name="coin_title_pp_01">Baskets (A)</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pp_01">There are six baskets scattered around the beach, all are upside-down and have a coin visible inside. The only time you can get at them is in &lt;b>episode 2&lt;/b>. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Stand on top and wait until one of the purple Bullet Bills starts to track you. Hop out of the way just before the bullet hits the basket (to avoid getting hurt). The bullet blows up the basket and you can get the coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        The black and gold bullets also blow up baskets but since they don\'t track you it\'s impossible to control where they land. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        With a couple of the harder to reach baskets you may have to stand nearby and then get the bullet to chase you to the basket. &lt;br>&lt;br>
		Visible in all episodes but &lt;b>only reachable in episode 2&lt;/b>.</string>

    <string name="coin_title_pp_07">Pirate ship ramp</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pp_07">Enter the park and go to the start of the pirate ship ride, see the walk-through for &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b>. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        At the ramp, instead of boarding a ship, drop into the water and find the blue coin floating inside the ramp support. To get it, hop up from the water and start &lt;i>hover&lt;/i>ing until you reach the coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Moving around might be better than &lt;i>hover&lt;/i>ing straight up. This may require several tries but you can ground pound right before falling to get the last bit of height. So this one is largely a matter of persistence. &lt;br>&lt;br>
		Available &lt;b>all episodes except 2 and 4&lt;/b>.</string>

    <string name="coin_title_pp_08">Pirate ship cage</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pp_08">Enter the park and from the ride staircase that leads up to the two rocking ships, jump across to the second ship and ride it up to the left as in the &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b> coin hunt. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        When it has enough momentum to reach the platform above grated box, stand near the front, hop and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> over to it. Pound the gate in front to get inside the cage and collect the coin there. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        It\'s likely you will get this coin without going out of your way in &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b>. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_title_pp_09">Pirate ship platform</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pp_09">From the cage mentioned in the "Pirate ship cage" coin, get to the top of the cage. You now need to get to the platform directly overhead.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Wait until the pirate ship is about to make one of its complete turns (this happens every three swings), then hop on the front end of the hull for a boost, hop off, and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to the platform. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Don\'t worry if you don\'t do it the first time since this one of the more difficult pieces of acrobatics in the game. It looks like it would be easier to jump onto the square tip of the bow, but the hull is a lot easier to land on and you probably won\'t slip off.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Once on the platform get the coin which is just sitting there. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_title_pp_11">Above pirate ships</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pp_11">Get to the platform where you collect the shine in &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b>, (see the StrategyWiki walk-through for that episode.)&lt;br>&lt;br>
        You can spot the coin floating a bit below to the right. Hop and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> until you\'re over it, then drop to collect it.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        You will probably land in the water so don\'t worry about falling. &lt;br>&lt;br>
