    <string name="coin_title_rh_03">Tower scaffolding</string>

    <string name="coin_descr_rh_08">Check lower level of catwalks to find a blue coin next to two gold coins almost directly above the crane at end of a beam. To reach with the rocket nozzle, fire from the grates on the ship to reach the pink grate structure above. Hop east (toward the buildings) to the scaffolding, go right and drop to land on the beam with the coins. Alternatively, try walking the beam connecting the ledge with buildings to the catwalks, then hovering to the beam with the coins. Appears in all episodes.</string>

    <string name="coin_title_rh_10">Catwalk drop</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_rh_10">Check the southern part of the catwalks to find a column of coins below the end of a beam. To reach with the rocket nozzle, hop and fire at the base of the beam\'s support, you should get enough of a lift to get the blue coin but not all of the gold coins. Alternatively, walk the beam connecting the ledge with buildings to the catwalks, continue in the same direction and ride the lift to the next higher level. Continue, hovering around the crane and a beam, to reach the beam with the coins. When you reach the end of the beam just drop off to collect them. Appears in all episodes.</string>

    <string name="coin_descr_rh_18">Locate a graffiti cross on the side of the tower. Locate a corresponding cross on the front of one of the buildings near the fruit towers. Wash one cross off to make a blue coin appear at the other cross, then quickly get to the other cross to collect the coin before it disappears.
