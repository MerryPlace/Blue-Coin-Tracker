    <string name="coin_descr_pv_08">Bear left from bridge at the start and locate the plateau with the fruit tree and a red mushroom. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        There is a graffiti M on the front side, wash it off to get a coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_title_pv_09">Underside M</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pv_09">Bear right from bridge at the start and locate a well to the underside next to a red mushroom. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Ground pound the gate to get through. Look around for a sliding grate, climb onto it and ride to another section. (If you\'ve completed &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b> then you\'ve already gotten used to doing this kind of thing.) &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Make a U-turn to the left and follow the grate to a swing, then drop and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> to a vertical grate in front of you. (Alternatively, drop to the swing and hop from the swing to the vertical grate.)&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Climb to the top of the grate, immediately turn around and &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> over to the top of the grate you were just under. Hop to the section on the right, this is a ledge around the well you came through at the start. Go around behind the well and adjust the camera to look above you to find a graffiti M. Wash it off to get a coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        To get back to civilization, follow the path until it turns to the left, then &lt;i>hover&lt;/i> straight across to another section. Go right and slowly go over the edge to a vertical grate. Flip the gate to the other side, the go up to the underside of the section you were just on. Ride the sliding grate here to the underside of the section with the well. &lt;br>
        Get the gate and flip it, then wall jump out the well to end up where you started. Note, the M is there even at night, though it\'s nearly impossible to see, so it\'s better to do this in the daytime episodes. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_pv_10">Locate the graffiti triangle on the end of the wall in front of the hot spring. &lt;br>
        Then follow the path right from the hot spring to an area with lots of little yellow mushrooms. Across the path from those locate the corresponding triangle on a cliff face.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        Wash the graffiti from one triangle to make a coin pop out at the other triangle, then get to the other location before it disappears. The symbols are close enough together so that it should be no problem to reach the coins in time, but using the slip-slide move may help. &lt;br>&lt;br>
		&lt;b>Appears all episodes.&lt;/b></string>

    <string name="coin_title_pv_12">M by the Mayor</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pv_12">When you recover FLUDD in &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b> (see the walk-through for that episode), check the platform next to you to find a graffiti M under it. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Wash it off to get a coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_descr_pv_15">Wash the sign, which is near the end of the bridge as you enter, in order to get this coin. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        The sign, which tells you about the hot spring, appears only in the daytime. &lt;br>&lt;br>

    <string name="coin_title_pv_16">Wash the moon</string>
    <string name="coin_descr_pv_16">Stand on the golden mushroom where the mayor was in &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b>. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Switch the camera to over-the-shoulder view, look at the moon and start spraying. When you hit the right spot a coin pops out. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        This is one the best hidden coins in the game, but there is a rather oblique hint. In &lt;b>episode 8&lt;/b> talk to the Pianta lady in the lavender top, she\'s dancing to the right of the main group. &lt;br>
        She talks about the mayor\'s wife\'s secret stash, referring to one of the secret shines on this level, and then mentions that the mayor may also have a stash. &lt;br>
        So if you were able to solve the puzzle for the secret shine maybe you\'re supposed to do something similar with the mayor. &lt;br>
        Does not appear in the daytime since the moon isn\'t visible. &lt;br>&lt;br>
		Appears &lt;b>episodes 1, 3, 5 and 7&lt;/b> (night time).</string>

    <string name="coin_descr_pv_17">Once you get FLUDD in &lt;b>episode 3&lt;/b>, make your way to the pond then follow the stream until it ends. In the area to the right there is a Pianta whose backpack is on fire. &lt;br>&lt;br>
        Chase him around with your &lt;i>squirt nozzle&lt;/i> going until you put the fire out, then talk to him to get a blue coin as a reward. &lt;br>&lt;br>
