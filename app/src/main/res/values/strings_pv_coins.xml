    <string name="coin_descr_pv_09">Bear right from bridge at the start and locate a well to the underside next to a red mushroom. Ground pound the gate to get through. Look around for a sliding grate, climb onto it and ride to another section. (If you\'ve completed episode 3 then you\'ve already gotten used to doing this kind of thing.) Make a U-turn to the left and follow the grate to a swing, then drop and hover to a vertical grate in front of you. (Alternatively, drop to the swing and hop from the swing to the vertical grate.) Climb to the top of the grate, immediately turn around and hover over to the top of the grate you were just under. Hop to the section on the right, this is a ledge around the well you came through at the start. Go around behind the well and adjust the camera to look above you to find a graffiti M. Wash it off to get a coin. To get back to civilization, follow the path until it turns to the left, then hover straight across to another section. Go right and slowly go over the edge to a vertical grate. Flip the gate to the other side, the go up to the underside of the section you were just on. Ride the sliding grate here to the underside of the section with the well. Get the gate and flip it, then wall jump out the well to end up where you started. Note, the M is there even at night, though it\'s nearly impossible to see, so it\'s better to do this in the daytime episodes. Appears all episodes.</string>
